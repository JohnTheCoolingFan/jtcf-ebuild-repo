	<longdescription>Doasedit is a shellscript to edit files with root privileges via doas while minimizing doas usage. To accomplish this, files are first copied to /tmp and made user-writable. The editor is then run in user context to edit this file. If the content was altered the changes are written back to the original file via a doas command after the editor was closed.</longdescription>
